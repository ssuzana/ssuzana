### Hi there, I'm Suzana. ðŸ‘‹

- I hold a PhD in Mathematics from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and have also completed both a BS and MS in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Bucharest. I have a diverse range of teaching experience, currently lecturing at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

- I have a strong background in coding with experience in several programming languages and frameworks. I am well-versed in Python, and have familiarity with JavaScript, C++, and MySQL. Additionally, I am skilled in using various frameworks and libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Flask. 

- I'm always eager to learn and keep up with the latest trends, and I would be happy to collaborate on Machine Learning projects. I believe I would be a valuable asset to any team working on advanced mathematical and technological projects.
